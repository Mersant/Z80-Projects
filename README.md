## The Z80 Microprocesor
The Zilog Z80 is a simple, 8-bit microprocessor originating from the late 1970s. It is the only microprocessor I would say I am entirely "fluent" in programming using assembly, though I have dabbled in x86 assembly and assembly for the RCA CDP1802. My interest in the processor began when I got a Timex Sinclair 1000 off of eBay. This particular system ran off of a Zilog Z80, but programming in assembly was desperately impractical as you had to hand compile your own code. This entailed writing the program in assembly, looking up each command in the datasheet for the Zilog Z80, writing down every command in its binary form, converting that binary into decimal, then you had to hop on the computer and poke in every single line of code, one by one by using the POKE(addr, value) function. I attempted to make a small "IDE" for programming in assembly on the system, (I only had ~1.4K of available memory to work with so it was more of a memory viewer) but after a runaway loop corrupted the program before I could back it up to a cassette tape, I gave up.

Fast forward a few years later and I got a Sharp PC-G830 pocket computer, which you can see pictured above. This system is *much* easier to program in assembly and so I quickly got to work. This system was particularly exciting because I now had 32k of RAM to work with instead of 2k, the possibilities are practically endless! You're able to program on the computer by writing code into the integrated text editor, and then executing it after building it via the built-in assembler. Be careful though! If you forget a return statement or you have a non-stop function overwriting system memory you'll corrupt the memory and have to do a hard-reset, just like for the Timex Sinclair 1000. This problem is mostly mitigated, however, by placing a return statement at the end of the program and taking videos with your smartphone of you scrolling through the code on the computer to "back it up."

## What you'll find in this repository

This repository contains some code I have made for the Z80 microprocessor. I hope to one day attempt to make a procedurally generated dungeon crawler, though school has prevented me from having to time to do so lately. I will probably add more code to this repo as a more secure way of backing it up than smartphone videos, but hopefully what I have so far is of interest to you.
